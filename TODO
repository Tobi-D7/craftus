figure out why only sometimes a crash happens when in lava (most likely due to renderer trying to figure out what is visible and it shits itself when you're inside of a block)

make fall damage use a actual formula instead of just checking for velocity

add gui stuff for gamerules

difficulty (speedrunning hardcore would be fun on this)

multiplayer (fuck this, i've spent 2 fucking days trying to get a socket working on it and nothing)

custom skins

mobs

sound and music (this is being a bitch as well, trying to use opus examples found in dkp and getting undefined references)

fire

sort textures into a more minecraft way (resource and data packs?)

lighting

make doors actually work

gates and fences

hunger

hud stuff for hp

day night cycle

weather

stats like how many kills, time survived and player deaths

tnt

dimensions

crafting (probs using json for crafting stuff)

furnace

ores

potions

projectiles

liquids

block hardness and explosion resistance

redstone

items

weapons

armour

menu when you die (maybe cause of death as well)

add beds (bed bombs?)

add thing to enable cheats/commands in a world

inventory

animated textures

transparent textures

any help would be appreciated here
